Born in 1998 and a Berlin native, Björn has been playing the drums for over 15 years, breaking countless sticks along the way. He founded his first band, _Jigsaw_, in 2013 and was an integral part of his school band, _Wilmacoustix_. Björn later teamed up with Go(&oslash;)dy and Amon for their debut collaboration, _Dup Steppas_. Juggling multiple projects, he played in two bands simultaneously until they merged to form _Goatless_.

Outside of music, Björn has a passion for boxing and traveling. Recognized as one of the greatest drummers on the planet, he never misses a beat.
