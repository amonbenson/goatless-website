## What do we do?

Founded in 2020 and having played on various stages across Berlin, Goatless made their international debut in 2022. Their style has evolved to span a variety of genres, fusing rock and pop with hip-hop elements. With catchy medleys, originals, and creative covers, Goatless captivates the spirit of artists such as Daft Punk, Gorillaz and Red Hot Chili Peppers.
